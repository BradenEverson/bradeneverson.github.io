                        One of the things I have always been super interested in is the world of physical simulations.
                        On top of this, I've loved IoT devices ever since I first got into programming. One of the first
                        projects I ever made was some very hacky Jack-O-Lantern that used the Google Cloud Voice
                        Recognition service to dispense candy when people said "trick or treat" into it. As my skills in
                        Rust developed, I found myself very interested in seeing <i>if</i> I could create something I've
                        always wanted to: <b>a system of modular peripherals that could be visualized through a 3D
                            render dependent on the peripheral readings.</b>
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        For example, this could take the form of a physical plane armed with a gyroscope and
                        accelerometer. As pitch and poll vary, a 3D render of the plane would respond accordingly. This
                        has many real-world applications, but truthfully I enjoy the silly ones.
