            <h3>The Beginning</h3>
            <p>
                I tend to have this dangerous habit involving projects and the
                time at which I choose to write them. Specifically, I get really
                into a project right when I'm about to have a handful of exams.
                This previous midterm batch was no exception. I found myself
                getting increasingly interested in the usage of
                <b>Webassembly</b> for creating advanced state machines that
                would then be exposed through a simple API into a static HTML
                frontend. At the same time as this, I wanted to make something
                spooky for Halloween. Lastly, and most importantly, I was really
                missing my dog this past semester. All of these seemed to
                accumulate into a perfect storm of project inspiration:

                <b
                    >I should create Five Night's at Freddy's in the browser

            <p>It was a perfect idea.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>A Quick Explanation of Five Night's At Freddy's</h3>
            <p>
                Before we dive into the code and all of the fun stuff I can't
                wait to write about, we should probably quickly go over what
                game I'm attempting to <s>steal</s> draw inspiration from. Five
                Night's at Freddy's is an indie horror game involving 4 robot
                mascots hunting down the player. The player is imobile, and must
                instead use the plethora of security cameras at their disposal
                and 2 electronically controlled metal doors to prevent the
                monsters from getting into their office. The doors and cameras
                both draw significant power from the office, and using all of
                the power up will result in an outage, leaving the player
                completely exposed to any enemies wandering nearby. In order to
                win, the player must successfully ward off all enemies and
                prevent them from getting in until the in-game clock hits 6 AM.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is primarily how I want my game to function, however there
                are a few deviations between the official game and mine. Most
                specifically, in the original Five Night's at Freddy's the
                office layout is <b>fixed</b>. In creating my version, I wanted
                to play around with randomized office generation, as I had an
                hunch I would probably need to use graphs for this task and that
                sounded fun (I got nerd sniped).

            <h3>Starting Development</h3>
            <p>
                To begin this project, I created a new Rust crate and scaffolded
                out the general structs I thought I would need. Primarily, a
                <b class="inline-code">GameState</b> struct responsible for
                ticking the game forward, managing power consumption, signalling
                enemy behavior, and declaring when the player has won/lost. A
                simplified version of this struct looks as follows:
            </p>

            <div class="rust">
                <pre><code class="language-rust">
                /// The game's internal state, responsible for keeping track of what enemies we have, where they
                /// are, if our doors are closed, what time it is, etc!
                pub struct GameState {
                    /// The current time
                    ticks: u64,
                    /// The map as graph-like structure
                    pub map: Map,
                    /// If the left door is closed
                    left_door: bool,
                    /// If the right door is closed
                    right_door: bool,
                    /// Are the cameras on
                    cameras_on: bool,
                    /// How much power is left
                    power: i32,
                    /// The current power draw (per tick)
                    draw: i32,
                    /// Are we dead?
                    dead: bool,
                    /// What is our target ticks
                    ticks_needed_to_win: u64,
                }
              </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                A lot of this struct is simply bool tags and tick tracking. This
                makes sense as this entire state machine is essentially a
                slightly more complicated counter. Every time
                <b class="inline-code">tick()</b> is called we increment the
                tick count by 1, and decrement the current power by whatever the
                draw is. Draw is determined by the amount of door shut and
                camera on flags that are on, and once the ticks reached is
                higher than the ticks required to win, we return that the game
                has been won!
            </p>

            <p>
                From this perspective, the
                <b class="inline-code">tick()</b> method could be written simply
                as follows:
            </p>

            <div class="rust">
                <pre><code class="language-rust">
                    impl GameState {
                        pub fn tick(&mut self) -> bool {
                            self.ticks += 1;

                            self.power -= self.draw;

                            self.ticks == self.ticks_needed_to_win
                        }
                    }
              </code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                Of course, this is an overly simplified perspective on the game,
                as we also need to have a <i>reason</i> why the player might be
                checking cameras or closing doors. We need enemies.
            </p>

            <h3>Enemies</h3>
            <p>
                Enemies(or as I named them in the source code, <i>freaks</i>)
                are inherently dynamic entities that should behave differently
                from one another. After all, if you had a game where every enemy
                simply b-lined it straight to you, you'd have a pretty
                monotonous game. For example, my dog Teller would likely prey
                and stalk directly towards me, whereas my cockapoo Frank would
                probably wander aimlessly in hopes that he may accidentally win.
                As such, enemy behavior would be better represented as a
                <b>Trait</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <b class="inline-code">EnemyBehavior</b> trait encapsulates
                this providing a single function, also named
                <b class="inline-code">tick()</b>. An enemies behavior should be
                determined based on the context of where they currently are in
                the map and what their previous actions were, therefore this
                method takes a reference to the existing
                <b class="inline-code">GameState</b>. From this, the behavior
                returns an <b class="inline-code">Action</b> enum with the
                following variants:
            </p>

            <div class="rust">
                <pre><code class="language-rust">
                    pub enum Action {
                        /// Move to room `RoomId`
                        Move(RoomId),
                        /// Perform some special action specific to the enemy
                        Special(Box&lt;dyn SideEffect&gt;),
                        /// Attack the player if close enough
                        Attack,
                        /// Or do nothing
                        Nothing,
                    }
              </code></pre>
            </div>
            <i>
                Note: the <b class="inline-code">Special</b> variant exists to
                allow special enemies to do things like disable room cameras or
                spawn in new enemies. This isn't currently utilized with the
                enemies I have created, but I wanted it to exist as an option in
                case that changes in the future.
            </i>
            <p>
                Furthermore, as mentioned earlier with Frank, what if an enemy
                needs to do some sort of randomized operations? In this case,
                it's likely a better practice to include a mutable reference to
                some Rng for any implementation that may need it, preventing
                them from creating their own Rng once every tick (which does not
                sound very efficient). With all of these considerations in mind,
                here's what the final design for the
                <b class="inline-code">EnemyBehavior</b> trait looks like:
            </p>
            <div class="rust">
                <pre><code class="language-rust">
                    pub trait EnemyBehavior {
                        fn tick(&mut self, curr_state: &GameState, id: EnemyId) -> Vec&lt;Action&gt;;
                    }
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <i>
                Note: We return a
                <b class="inline-code">Vec&lt;Action&gt;</b> instead of just an
                <b class="inline-code">Action</b> to account for enemies that
                perform several actions in a turn (such as turn off cameras and
                move at the same time)</i
            >
            <p>
                Now, in order to dynamically hold all enemies with different
                behavior, we can hold onto a
                <b class="inline-code">Box&lt;dyn EnemyBehavior&gt;</b> to allow
                for dynamic usage of the trait objects! For the reason of borrow
                checker rules that involved the
                <b class="inline-code">GameState</b> owning the enemies and
                trying to mutate them and itself at the same time, I moved the
                enemy container out of <b class="inline-code">GameState</b> and
                into a new <b class="inline-code">Game</b> struct that would
                hold onto the enemies, the current game, and an Rng instance to
                send through during ticks. One more cool thing we do here is
                instead of holding the enemys in one spot and sharing references
                to them all over the place, the game actually stores them in a
                <b class="inline-code">SlotMap&lt;EnemyId, Freak&gt;</b> and
                shares the copyable <b class="inline-code">EnemyId</b> all over
                the place. Neat!
            </p>
            <i
                >Note: SlotMaps are pretty much exactly the same as HashMaps,
                but upon insertion you are returned a generated key instead of
                needing to provide one. The Rust slotmap crate provides a macro
                for describing a attributeless struct as a slotmap key, which as
                far as I've seen essentially boils it down into a tagged u64.
                This EnemyId struct is one of these key types, and for map
                generation we do something similar with a RoomId</i
            >
            <h3>Adding Frank</h3>
            <p>
                Now that we have the blueprints for how an enemy's behavior is
                derived, let's go through the simplest enemy AI, Frank!
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img src="./assets/frank.png" />
            </div>
            <p>
                As previously stated, if Frank were a murderous beast bent on
                killing a player, he would probably do it by wandering
                aimlessly. To reflect this, Frank's AI behavior will move about
                randomly. A small part of Frank's implementation involves the
                <b class="inline-code">Map</b> struct that I haven't gone over
                yet and will not go over until after this section, so just know
                for now that all you need to know is that a Map is collection of
                Rooms where each Room has a collection of Ids that point to
                other rooms. With this knowledge of state in mind, implementing
                Frank is as easy as:
            </p>

            <div class="rust">
                <pre><code class="language-rust">
                    pub struct FrankBehavior&lt;RNG: Rng&gt; {
                        rng: RNG,
                    }

                    impl&lt;RNG: Rng&gt; EnemyBehavior for FrankBehavior&lt;RNG&gt; {
                        fn tick(&mut self, curr_state: &GameState, id: EnemyId) -> Vec&lt;Action&gt; {
                            if let Some(enemy_room) = curr_state.map.get_enemy_room(id) {
                                let rooms = curr_state[enemy_room].connections();
                                let goto = rooms.choose(&mut self.rng);

                                if goto == &curr_state.office.root {
                                    vec![Action::Attack]
                                } else {
                                    vec![Action::Move(*goto)]
                                }
                            } else {
                                vec![Action::Nothing]
                            }
                        }
                    }
              </code></pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Map Generation</h3>
            <p>
                Since we've been assuming this
                <b class="inline-code">Map</b> struct has existed, so we might
                as well jump into that now! The map itself will be yet another
                <b class="inline-code">Slotmap</b>, this time containing a
                special <b class="inline-code">Room</b> struct.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this way, all a Map really is is a graph of nodes with Room
                data, with connections essentially acting as "hallways" between
                these rooms. This makes enemy AI for pathfinding nothing more
                than a simple graph traversal. As far as generating the actual
                map goes, there are a few ground rules that every Map should
                follow:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Every Map should have a Root "office" that the player
                    occupies and enemies target.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every office should have only a left and right hallway
                    connection. These rooms signal to the player that an enemy
                    is right outside their door
                </li>
                <li>
                    All remaining rooms should connect in some way (either
                    directly or through a sequence of rooms) to either the left
                    or right higway. Why would we want a building that doesn't
                    have rooms fully connected?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So with these rules in mind, map generation should start with a
                "root" batch of nodes, manually creating an office and it's
                adjacent hallways. From there, rng should take the wheel and
                create some N number of new rooms with connections to the
                previously existent rooms (any room but the office). In the

                through and create a few extra random connections to reduce the

                The method returns a RootOfficeInfo struct that bundles up the
                office and hallways nicely. It also returns a list of all Rooms
                where an enemy spawning is viable, to prevent enemies from
                spawing in a random room which would be pretty unfair. The code

                This is definitely a lot of code, but nothing too crazy. In my
                experience Slotmaps have been a very nice paradigm for
                graph-based structures, as it keeps you away from throwing
                everything in boxes or refcells. With the graph designed like
                this, we can design a pretty simple pathfinding algorithm by
                attemtping to traverse the Room graph until we find the room
                with the target ID. This method keeps context of the previous
                rooms explored while checking <i>every</i> possible connection
                in a queue. This is my preferred paradigm of graph traversal in
                Rust, as it makes state management and comprehensibility much
                better for myself than a recursive function may (although I
                cannot lie and say recursive functions aren't awesome (although
                I cannot lie and say recursive functions aren't awesome (...)))

            <h3>Updating <b class="inline-code">tick()</b></h3>
            <p>
                Now that we have some more advanced game logic and data
                structures in place, we'll need to move all enemies forward
                every time they're supposed to. Going back to that simplified
                tick method from before, now is the time to get that a little
                more beefy. There isn't too much to add because the code is all
                segmented in a nice and cohesive way, we simply need to iterate
                over enemies, get their actions, perform their actions if
                possible, and check if those actions would kill us!

            <h3>Putting it All Together</h3>
            <p>
                Now that the Rust logic was finished, porting it into
                Webassembly was very very easy. Throwing a
                <b class="inline-code">#[wasm_bindgen]</b> proc macro atop a few
                structs and impl blocks here and there and we have access to the
                game state machine as an opaque type. Interfacing with it and
                moving forward the game logic did have it's slight JS
                challenges, such as translating the graph into a visual UI.
                These challenges weren't a part of my initial goal, but I still
                had a lot of fun figuring out how to fit all of the pieces
                together. As such, however, I won't go too in depth about them
                here. Maybe there's a world where they're covered more in a part
                2 :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I had a really fun time making this entire project. It
                demanded a lot of unique problems to be solved that really
                required me to whip out some good data structures to pull off.
                This and the portability of wasm made it a very cool experience.
